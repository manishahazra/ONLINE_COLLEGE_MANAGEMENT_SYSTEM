            <<p>  The overall function of the NSS advisory committees at the college level is to advise on the various activities of the NSS unit based on the felt needs of the students and the community. The NSS Advisory Committee should meet regularly at least four times during the year.
The National Service Scheme (NSS) Advisory Committee at the college level is chaired by the college principal. The committee's role is to discuss and evaluate the NSS program. The committee includes members from a variety of backgrounds, such as education, administration, social work, and technical fields. 
The NSS Advisory Committee plans the NSS program for the college, including regular activities and special camping programs. The committee also evaluates projects after they are completed, and uses the lessons learned to plan future projects. 
The NSS is a student empowerment program that involves campus community interaction. Students can enroll in the NSS for free by contacting the NSS Programme Officer at their school or college. Students who complete the required hours of service and attend a special camp receive an NSS certificate from the university. 
            <p>
